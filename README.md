This repository contains specifications files for the Foundations of Applied Mathematics labs.

The labs in this curriculum aim to introduce computational and mathematical concepts, walk through implementations of those concepts in Python, and use industrial-grade code to solve interesting, relevant problems.
Lab assignments are usually about 5-10 pages long and include code examples (yellow boxes), important notes (green boxes), warnings about common errors (red boxes), and about 3-7 exercises (blue boxes).
The lab manuals can be downloaded from [foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io](http://foundations-of-applied-mathematics.github.io/).
